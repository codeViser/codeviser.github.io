- [Predictive Analytics](/work/#analytics): DAA, trading analytics
- [Software Development](/work/#dev) for Trading
- [Vision/Recognition](/work/#vision): Char Recog in Banks, Road Segmentation
- [Language Modelling/Understanding](/work/#nlp): Character MT, Sentiment Analysis, Word Relatedness, Sentribute
- [Social Impact](/work/#social):  AR Military Dev,  Violence Detect

### Hessian View of loss landscape in Vision Transformers
*Research Assisstance under [Sidak Pal Singh](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=c59mPS4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Thomas Hofmann](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=T3hAyLkAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Data Analytics Lab](https://da.inf.ethz.ch/)* <br><br/>
Considering transformers produce powerful learning representations, we explore their parametric loss landscape encoded in approximate second-order curvature. We crucially ask, what meaningful subset of parameters govern convergence in them?
