"_Hey there! If you haven't landed on this page by accident, chances are that you already met CodeViser! ViseHub is his honest effort in highlighting his academic, professional, and idiosyncratic journey thus far!_"

### Focal Interests & Aspirations
Statistical & Sequential Learning, Optimization & Control, Game Theory, Stochastic Decision Dynamics, Econometrics

> <small> Pursuing research in designing & explaining intelligent systems in sequential/game-theoretic settings, I wish to create interpretable, mathematically transparent, and robust knowledge systems of inference facilitating decisions. </small>
> <small> Strategic decision settings, entailing high-risk yet compelling explanability stemming from a melange of stochastic natural phenomena, particularly excite me. Predicting dynamics in uncertain games, economic interactions, and physical processes are prime examples.</small>
