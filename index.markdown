_Hey there! If you haven't landed on this page by accident, chances are that you already met CodeViser! ViseHub is his honest effort in highlighting his academic, professional, and idiosyncratic journey thus far!_

### Focal Interests & Aspirations
Statistical Learning, Optimization & Control, Reinforcement Learning, Cognitive Dynamics & Game Theory, Econometrics

> Pursuing mathematical research in designing & explaining intelligent systems in social/game-theoretic settings, I wish to create unbiased, interpretable, and robust knowledge systems of inference facilitating decisions. In the long run, I desire to make seminal contributions in machine cognition, guarantees in behavioral estimates, and fundamentals of AGI.
