### Focal Interests & Aspirations
Statistical Learning, Optimization & Control, Game Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Decision Dynamics, Econometrics

> Pursuing mathematical research in designing & explaining intelligent systems in social/game-theoretic settings, I wish to create unbiased, interpretable, and robust knowledge systems of inference facilitating decisions. In the long run, I desire to make seminal contributions in machine cognition, guarantees in behavioral estimates, and fundamentals of AGI.
