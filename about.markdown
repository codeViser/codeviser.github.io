I am a usual morning person, who prefers to hike. Given nice company, I also like night strolls. Visiting populous places of celebration automatically sets my mood on a high tone! Admittedly, I also prefer sea-side a tad more than mountains, especially during cloudy days with gusty winds.

In my leisure time I prefer exploring varied culture and places around me. In case the weather isn't forgiving, I would then instead prefer watching detective and investigative shows slurping tomato soup! One way or the other, I look for ways to beat monotonicity, which otherwise makes me sleepy real fast. Consequently, puzzle games like Codenames, Escape Rooms, have become some of my favorite online plays.

Being jocular, I usually become a central adhesive for my colleagues. This also means I like playing co-op games a lot, especially if they are strategic and behavioural. Poker has been my recent favorite. Logical debates and discussions on geopolitical strategies or some random good-to-know natural phenomena is always welcome too!
